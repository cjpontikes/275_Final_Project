FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL
Chris Pontikes (1499276) and Brighton Greet (1494333)

Idea: Family Tree Generator

Take in a text file with a specified format to create a family tree out of.
The names of the people listed in the text file will certain flags to tell the
text-reading function information for sorting. The format will be:

V Generation_number firstname_lastname

E firstname_lastname(start) firstname_lastname(finish)

From this text file, we will be able to build a family tree of the given family using
a non-binary tree. V and E will be flags to declare if it is a node or a path.

Generation_number will tell us where in the tree each person goes (1 will go at the top of the tree,
the nth generation will be at the bottom of the tree)
Example:

V 2 John_Pontikes
V 3 Peter_Pontikes
E John_Pontikes Peter_Pontikes

will create a node for John and a node for Peter and the two will be connected


The family tree will be displayed via visualize.py

Other functions that can be included could be typing in a family member's name and outputting the
number of children they have

Another function included could be inputting a person's name and outputting their siblings or parents
